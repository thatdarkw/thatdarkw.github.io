# Summary -
Medium rated TryHackMe machine which is pretty straight forward, has vulnerable anydesk installed and we abuse that to get initial access and for privilege escalation we take advantage of misconfiguration of suid which then gives us an authority to set any type of capabilities for programs. Overall a pretty fun and easy room.

# Enumeration -
Nmap here we go...

### nmap -

```bash

_For some reason, I have to scan twice to reveal 7070 port_

Hmmm... Looks like AnyDesk is running on port 7070. Let's see if anydesk has any exploit available.

Okay, so first two looks like priv esc for Windows. 3rd one is what we are after. Time to read the code.

# Exploitation -
Okay, so we need to change the ip and shell code. Do not change port number, the port mentioned in this exploit is a UDP one. Anydesk run on that port as well. (Was stuck here for a long time because of this...)

![](Pasted image 20220715185729.png)
_As you can see 50001 UDP port is open..._

There is also a comment saying how we can generate the payload.

![](Pasted image 20220715192701.png)

So, using that we can create a shellcode and edit our exploit accordingly. (There is a metasploit module for this exploit as well but I had no luck with it. Feel free to try it.)

# Post Exploitation -
Let's get ssh key for stable access. Its password locked so john comes to the rescue. `ssh2john` to get the hash and john to crack the hash.

![](Pasted image 20220714205059.png)

So, <**redacted**> is the password for id_rsa key.

Let's run linpeas...

![](Pasted image 20220714204214.png)

Ah, pwnkit exploit... Probably false positive.

![](Pasted image 20220714204241.png)

Hmm....

![](Pasted image 20220715130827.png)

Okay, this is interesting... It is what you think it is. We can use this binary to set capabilities for any program. Remember setuid capability?

![](Pasted image 20220715191505.png)

Time to head to gtfobins to grab the capability exploit.

```bash
./python3 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'
```

And we got root!!! :D
